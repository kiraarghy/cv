## 👩🏻‍💻 Technical Experience

**Senior Software Engineer** @ [Rasa](https://rasa.com/) *(Nov 2020 -> Present)*
Machine learning tooling company

Senior IC and GQL technical lead on Studio project, a greenfeld rebuild of our core ML
learning reinforcement product ofering using GQL and subscriptons. The aim here is to
provide beter user experience by integraton of real tme updates using subscriptons,
increasing brand cohesion through a design library based on Chakra UI, and increase
developer velocity through experience improvements such as introducing the graphql-
codegen package. [Rasa Studio](https://rasa.com/product/rasa-studio/) was released Nov 2023.

Before we started the Studio product I lead technical advisement on product discovery to
product leadership for new product area, including technological choices, stafng estimaton,
scope, and timelines. I have contnued to be involved at a high level in estimations and scope
management.

I have lead Incident response to client scaling problems and where necessary debugging
client’s setups remotely, considered to be one of the most knowledgeable people at the
company on our legacy codebase.

Lead several initatives including:

1. Revamping and streamlining our Senior Fullstack Interview process, resultng in a 2 day
reducton in our recruitng timeline and increased confdence in candidate ofers.
2. Creating a structured process for onboarding new team members onto our legacy
codebase, resultng in a signifcant improvement in our responsiveness to client bugs as
well as freeing up senior engineers to work on product development.
3. With new stack, have worked on introducing guidance documentation establishing
‘norms’ of how we write our Frontend and Backend code.
4. Technical discovery on visual programming language allowing users to create Rasa bots
without having to write YAML.
5. Introducing Real Time Collaboration to our legacy stack using websockets.
Experienced in interviewing ICs at all levels, as well as EM candidates.
I take a lot of enjoyment from providing mentorship to junior members of my team and seeing
them grow as engineers as well as assistng other groups such as Codebar and FrauenLoop.
